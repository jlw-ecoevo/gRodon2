Description: This package infers growth rates of prokaryotic organisms by 
    calculating several codon usage statistics on a user-provided set of highly 
    expressed genes and the genome at large. In particular, it uses the MILC 
    statistic from the coRdon package as well as the codon pair bias 
    (Coleman et al. 2008).
